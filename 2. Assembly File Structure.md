# Assembly File Structure
## Breaking down the file structure:
![[Pasted image 20220614213341.png]]
##### Hello World code
```nasm
         global  _start

         section .data
message: db      "Hello World!"

         section .text
_start:
         mov     rax, 1
         mov     rdi, 1
         mov     rsi, message
         mov     rdx, 18
         syscall

         mov     rax, 60
         mov     rdi, 0
         syscall
```

### 1.  Labels:

Instructions and Operands refer to labels

### 2.  Instructions:

Operations performed by the CPU.

Ex: add rax, 1, mov rsp, rax, push rax

### 3.  Operands:


Entities operated on by the instructions

##### Main parts of the code:
```bash
`global _start`


`section .data`


`section .text`
```
### 4.  Directives:

Directs an action that is done during assembly process, in this example telling the program to start processing the instructions after _start label.

### 5.  Variables: 
Stuff that we can define and reuse. They are loaded into memory in the .data section when the program is run. They can be defined using db for a list of bytes, dw a list of words, dd for a list of digits, etc.
##### Using equ
We can also use the *equ* instruction with *$* to evaluate an expression.
In this example, we evaluate the length of the message variable.
```nasm
section .data
    message db "Hello World!", 0x0a
    length  equ $-message
```
