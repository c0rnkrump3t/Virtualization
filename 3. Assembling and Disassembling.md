# Assembling and Disassembling

## Assembling a file
Using NASM:

1.  Make a file called `helloWorld.s` (or `.asm`)

2.  This can be done through the terminal by typing `nano helloWorld.s` 

3.  Copy the code below into the file and then save

##### Hello World code
```nasm
      global _start

section .data
    message db "Hello World!"
    length equ $-message

section .text
_start:
    mov rax, 1
    mov rdi, 1
    mov rsi, message
    mov rdx, length
    syscall

    mov rax, 60
    mov rdi, 0
    syscall


```

5.  Assemble the code using the following command

`nasm -f elf64 helloWorld.s`

If you wanted to assemble in 32-bit code, use `-f elf`

Elf = Executable and Linkable Format

6.  You will generate a `helloWorld.o` object file that is assembled in machine code

8.  We link the file using `ld`

`ld -o helloWorld helloWorld.o`

If you wanted to assemble in 32-bit code, use

`-m elf_i386`

1.  Let's try executing the file:

`./helloWorld`

And we should see *Hello World!* as the output!

### Bash it!
We can make a bash script with a series of these commands so we donâ€™t have to keep typing them ourselves: 
``` bash
#!/bin/bash

fileName="${1%%.*}" # to remove .s extension

nasm -f elf64 ${fileName}".s"
ld ${fileName}".o" -o ${fileName}
[ "$2" == "-g" ] && gdb -q ${fileName} || ./${fileName}


```

After creating the file, run `chmod +x`  to make the bash file executable.

Now we don't have to run all the commands above every time we want to assemble, but simply `./assembler.sh helloWorld.s`

## Disassembling a file
#### First, what is Disassembly?
**TL:DR** -- Machine Language converted to Assembly Language

**More Detailed Explanation:** 
Disassembly is when Machine Language (remember the sequences of 1's and 0's?) is converted to Assembly Language (what we humans can better interpret, for example `mov ecx. [esp+4]`). There is no set way of how the Assembly Langguage will look like as there are different syntaxes available. This is done through an assembler,  in our case NASM, which translates Assembly to Macking Language. We write the Assembly Language and let the assembler to the rest.

In the code below, we use `objdump` tool that interprets machine code to the assembly instruction of hex codes. We type ` -M intel` because we want to instructions in Intel Syntax, however we could use other options like NASM or GAS syntax. We use the -d tag to disassemble the `.text` section. 

```bash
[c0rnkrump3t@fedora ~]$ objdump -M intel -d helloWorld

helloWorld:     file format elf64-x86-64


Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000401000 <_start>:
  401000:	b8 01 00 00 00       	mov    eax,0x1
  401005:	bf 01 00 00 00       	mov    edi,0x1
  40100a:	48 be 00 20 40 00 00 	movabs rsi,0x402000
  401011:	00 00 00 
  401014:	ba 0c 00 00 00       	mov    edx,0xc
  401019:	0f 05                	syscall 
  40101b:	b8 3c 00 00 00       	mov    eax,0x3c
  401020:	bf 00 00 00 00       	mov    edi,0x0
  401025:	0f 05                	syscall 

```

Note that there are a few minor changes to our disassembled code (machine lang to assembly lang).
	1. Message variable is replaced as value `0x402000` 
	2. Length variable is replaces as value `0x12`
	3. The assembler changed our `64-bit` registers to `32-bit` sub-registers in some instances. This is done to use less memory where possible.
	4. Finally, `mov` to `movabs` which are the same, and can bechanged back.
	
If we want to remove the machine code and addresses, simple add `--no-show-raw-insn --no-addresses` flags represented respectively.

```bash 
[c0rnkrump3t@fedora ~]$ objdump -M intel --no-show-raw-insn --no-addresses -d helloWorld 

helloWorld:     file format elf64-x86-64


Disassembly of section .text:

<_start>:
	mov    eax,0x1
	mov    edi,0x1
	movabs rsi,0x402000
	mov    edx,0xc
	syscall 
	mov    eax,0x3c
	mov    edi,0x0
	syscall 

```

Similarly we can show just the `.data` section of the code by using the
 `-sj. data` flag.
```bash
[c0rnkrump3t@fedora ~]$ objdump -M intel -sj .data helloWorld 

helloWorld:     file format elf64-x86-64

Contents of section .data:
 402000 48656c6c 6f20576f 726c6421           Hello World!  
```
**Or** 
```bash 
[c0rnkrump3t@fedora ~]$ objdump -sj .data helloWorld 

helloWorld:     file format elf64-x86-64

Contents of section .data:
 402000 48656c6c 6f20576f 726c6421           Hello World!      

```

Where Hello World is the flag.
